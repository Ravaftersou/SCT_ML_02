## 🏭️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project was developed as part of my internship at **Skillcrafts Technology**. It applies **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to segment retail store customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. The goal is to help businesses better understand customer behavior and develop targeted marketing strategies.

---

### 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the popular **Mall\_Customers.csv**, which contains customer demographic and behavioral data:

* `CustomerID`
* `Gender`
* `Age`
* `Annual Income (k$)`
* `Spending Score (1-100)`

---

### 🎯 Objectives

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Normalize and preprocess features
* Determine the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**
* Apply **K-Means Clustering** to group similar customers
* Visualize and interpret the resulting customer segments

---

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **pandas** – Data manipulation
* **matplotlib / seaborn** – Data visualization
* **scikit-learn** – Machine learning and clustering

---

### 📊 Visual Output

* **Elbow Curve** to find optimal `k`
* **Scatter plot** showing customer segments by spending habits and income
* Cluster centroids highlighted to interpret segment characteristics

---

### 💡 Key Learnings

* Practical understanding of **unsupervised learning**
* Importance of **feature selection** and **data scaling**
* How customer segmentation can drive **personalized marketing**
* Visualization as a tool to make clustering interpretable

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kmeans-customer-segmentation.git
cd kmeans-customer-segmentation
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

---

### 📌 Results

Each customer is assigned to a cluster (0–4), enabling:

* Identification of **high-value** customers
* Discovery of **price-sensitive** or **low-engagement** groups
* More effective and personalized marketing strategies
